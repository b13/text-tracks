# Text Tracks for Video files in TYPO3

When dealing with videos you stream locally (not YouTube etc), you might
want to add text track files (subtitles etc.). This is really important
for accessibility reasons.

Installing this extension does exactly this: You can link to VTT files
with video files when editing the metadata of a video file.

## Installation

    composer req b13/text-tracks

## Usage

Choose any local video in your file list, and you will see that you can
now choose a VTT files when editing the video, which is then rendered in the
frontend.

## License

The extension is licensed under GPL v2+, same as the TYPO3 Core. See the LICENSE file.

The extension is highly inspired from https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/66214 - thanks to Guide Schmechel for the initial work.
